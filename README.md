## ABSTRACT
Political ideologies are diverse and complex but can be approximated through one's choice of words.
In this project we used three different approaches to predict political ideology in
YouTube comment data. The first SVM model was trained on 500 self-labeled YouTube comments, the
second one on 36.000 presidential candidate’s Twitter post and the last one on 4000 sentences of US
parties’ electoral manifestos. Challenges were the access to training data, different content and syntax of available training
data sources, class imbalances in the data as well as manual labeling.
Results indicate that in all approaches political ideology can be predicted with above-chance accuracy.
The best results were acquired when the classifier was trained on the labeled YouTube comments (data
from the same data source) while ensuring that classes were appropriately balanced.
